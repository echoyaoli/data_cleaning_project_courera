variables and summaries calculated
=============================================
-group :Each row identifies the group which the subject belongs to, test or train. Adapted from the original files: "train/X_train.txt' and "test/X_test.txt" 

-subject:Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. Adapted from the original file "train/subject_train.txt"

-label: Each row identifies the acivity which the subject performed. Its level is 'walking','walking_upstair','walking_downstair','sitting','standing','lying'. Adapted from the original files: "acitivity_labels.txt",  "test/y_test.txt", and "train/y_train.txt".

(these three variables are the same in 'df','df_average','df-average_tidy')

They are features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
